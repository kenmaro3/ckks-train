# Server requests for gpu-runner (quadruped-gpu)

Written by the hekit controller session. The user approved it in that session on 2026-11-05
("Yes, use the runner"). gpu-runner runs the blocks in order. After each block it writes the
result path and `status: done` (or `status: failed` with the reason) under the block. It never
commits; the controller commits `results/quadruped/` and `docs/quadruped-log.md` by path.

Common rules for every block:

- Sync the repo at the commit in the block, using the gitignore-aware rsync already in use.
- Build once per commit:
  `cargo build --release -p hekit-bench --features parallel --bins`
- Before and after each run, record `nvidia-smi`, `df -h ~` and `uptime` in docs/quadruped-log.md.
- Do not kill other users' processes. The SLAM job uses 4 cores, so cap threads at 12.
- Run with nohup. Write logs to `results/quadruped/logs/<id>.log`.
- Wrap each run in `/usr/bin/time -v`.

## R-41-1: Task 41 Step 5, non-interactive eMLP-1, AfterUpdate, B = 32

- **purpose:** RQ1 spec metric on the same CPU as the official ReBoot run. Bootstraps are counted.
- **commit to sync:** 43f219f
- **working dir:** `~/hekit` (repo root on the server)
- **command:**
  ```
  RAYON_NUM_THREADS=12 /usr/bin/time -v ./target/release/mnist --mode noninteractive --placement after_update --batch 32 --subset 1024 --epochs 1 --transpose reuse --out results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_after_update_b32.json
  ```
- **expected duration:**
  - The first batch is logged after about 5–10 min.
  - A full epoch takes about 2–4 h.
  - If the log projects more than 5 h from the first 2 batches, stop after batch 8 and mark the block `partial`. The JSON is written per run, so record the log path either way.
- **GPU memory need:** 0 (CPU only)
- **RAM need:** about 25 GB
- **output path:** `results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_after_update_b32.json` and `results/quadruped/logs/R-41-1.log`

## R-41-2: Task 41 Step 5, AfterUpdate, B = 64

- Same as R-41-1, with `--batch 64`.
- **output path:** `results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_after_update_b64.json`
- **expected duration:** about 1.5–3 h, with the same partial rule as R-41-1.

## R-41-3: Task 41 Step 5, WhenNeeded, B = 32

- Same as R-41-1, with `--placement when_needed`.
- **output path:** `results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_when_needed_b32.json`

## R-41-4: Task 41 Step 5, WhenNeeded, B = 64

- Same as R-41-1, with `--placement when_needed --batch 64`.
- **output path:** `results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_when_needed_b64.json`

## R-41-5: Task 41 Step 5, AfterActivation, B = 32

- Same as R-41-1, with `--placement after_activation`.
- **output path:** `results/quadruped/mnist_emlp1_ni_after_activation_b32.json`
- **note:** this one is lower priority. Run it only after R-41-1 to R-41-4 are done.

M4 GPU blocks (Tasks 44–49) and Task 54 blocks will be appended here as that code lands. Each GPU
block will state its GPU memory need, and the tests skip with a message when the need is not met.
